# IlliniConnect

## Inspiration

Throughout my time on campus, I have realized that while making friends is easy, it is tough to find people interested in working on similar things as you. Outside of events like this hackathon, it is **extremely** tough to find others interested in building the same things. 

So, I decided to re-invent the idea of a networking app, realizing that the majority of those nowadays have become more of an opportunity to show off than to actually meet anyone (Linkedin, anyone?)

## What it does

IlliniConnect is an app that helps people learn more about the lives their fellow Illini lead, and helps them to connect and build relationships on that basis. 

Every day, you get to send one short update (only one) onto the platform about something that you've worked on or done during that day. These updates are then displayed to people on the basis of their own interests, decided by the AI-based algorithm that the app provides. (note that the LLM ranking functionality is not yet fully function, better explained in the challenges section)

## How we built it

I built this app primarily using the Swift programming language, as an iOS app. Without much prior experience in Swift, I learnt while making the project through online resources and YouTube. 

In combination with Swift for the front-end aspect of it, I used Firebase to manage the database and user authentication for IlliniConnect. 

## Challenges we ran into

As expected, the biggest challenge was time and magnitude of the project. Implementing a full social media, including the connection with the database as well as messaging, is not an easy task to accomplish in 36 hours. 

As a result, I had to cut short on multiple of the features that I was excited to include within the app, but nevertheless, will definitely be designing over the next few days as well!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Before beginning this hackathon, I wanted to challenge myself to go solo and try to finish an app during 36 hours. I am extremely proud of how far I was able to come, despite not even knowing either the programming language or the building environment before I started. 

Moreover, I am proud of the fact that I was able to lock in, concentrate, and work tirelessly on a singular project throughout the time on this Hackathon.

## What we learned

Throughout these 36 hours, I have learnt a large number of things, many of them about programming and languages, and a lot more about myself. 

Of course, I learnt Swift and Firebase, as well as how to create iOS apps with more ease from now on. At the same time, I also learnt my capabilities and potential when it comes to creating apps and building software within short periods of time!

## What's next for IlliniConnect

IlliniConnect's journey is barely started. There were a few features that weren't developed to my full pleasure over the 36 hours, purely due to the time constraint. So, I will first be working on perfecting those. 

Next, I will focus on releasing the app onto the App Store and ensuring that UIUC truly does use this app to connect and build a stronger community on campus!
